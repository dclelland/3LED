# 3LED

iOS/macOS client for LIFX lightbulbs

## Todo

### Tasks

- Initial menu configuration
    - Look into NSMenuDelegate and that special run loop thing
        - Will need to add timeouts to connection request
    
- Set up correct initial window positions

### Design

- Set light color
    - Is this finished?

- Set light waveform
    - Finish this view controller and explore how waveform setting should work

### Bugs

- getHue:saturation:brightness:alpha: not valid for the NSColor NSCalibratedWhiteColorSpace
