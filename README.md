# 3LED

macOS client for LIFX lightbulbs

## Todo

### Bugs

- Menu configuration
    - Look into NSMenuDelegate and that special run loop thing
    - Will need to add timeouts to connection request

- Colors
    - getHue:saturation:brightness:alpha: not valid for the NSColor NSCalibratedWhiteColorSpace
    
### Design

- Set up correct initial window positions

- Set light color
    - Is this finished?

- Set light waveform
    - Finish this view controller and explore how waveform setting should work

### Testing

- Launch at login
    - Archive binary and test this

### Features

- Can we add keyboard shortcuts?

- Look at adding a scene manager
